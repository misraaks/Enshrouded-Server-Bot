# Enshrouded-Server-Bot
A Discord bot that allows channel members to start and stop an Enshrouded server (running on the same PC as the bot.)

Commands are $startserver and $stopserver.


## TODO:
1. Write instructions
2. Move the big block of constants in the top to something like an .env

In the meantime, you can reference the first link below for installing the Enshrouded Server with steamcmd and the second link for setting up your Discord bot and getting your bot token.

Thanks to Stonley890, whose Minecraft bot I...ahem...adapted for this.
